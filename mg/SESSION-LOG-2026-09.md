# Session log — September 2026

What changed in September 2026, and why. Companion to
`mg/SESSION-LOG-2026-08.md`, which covers the month before it. `HANDOFF.md` §1
carries the dated state; this file carries the narrative.

## 2026-09-03 — the deployment, and what a cold machine found

**The day the project left this laptop.** Two QA sweeps in the morning, then the
fork was installed on a Contabo VPS from a clean Ubuntu 24.04 image — the first
time anybody has followed `LINUX-INSTALL.md` end to end on a machine that had
never run any of it.

**It found three defects in one evening**, and their shape is the result rather
than the individual bugs.

### The morning: two sweeps, findings 225–229

**The tenth sweep changed what counts as evidence.** Nine sweeps of reading had
each ended by finding a test that asserted something it could not detect (206,
221, 224). Reading cannot measure how widespread that is, so this one broke the
code on purpose: **fifteen deliberate breakages across six security-critical
features, all fifteen caught.** That is the strongest positive statement this
project has about its own verification, and it is a different claim from "the
suite is green".

Reading the same six features alongside found **225** — the login throttle's
1,000-key memory bound was the whole control's off switch, measured at 500
guesses without a lockout — and **226**, a failed `governance login` recorded
nowhere at all. **227 and 228** were registers describing a system that had
moved, including this project's own handoff.

**The eleventh sweep changed which half of each module it read**: the failure
branch, the code that only runs when something else has already gone wrong.
**229** — `deleteOrganisation` guarded everything up to the point of no return
and nothing after it, so a corrupt attachment index turned a completed,
irreversible deletion into a reported failure on both surfaces. Two siblings had
the same shape and were fixed with it.

### The evening: the VPS, and three defects nobody could have read

**230 — the dashboard had not built since 2026-09-02.** `ui/vite.config.ts`
keeps a hand-maintained list of module aliases; finding 213's fold added an
import to the browser and no line was added with it. The catch-all alias then
rewrote the import into a path with a _file_ in the middle of it. Nothing caught
it because the UI **typecheck** resolves through tsconfig `paths` — a different
mechanism, which stayed green — and `pnpm ui:build` is not one of the six
documented verification commands.

**231 — `--with-node` left the runtime off `PATH`.** nvm puts Node in a
per-user directory reached through `~/.bashrc`; the installer sourced it into
its own shell, built successfully, and exited. `openclaw` is a symlink to a file
whose shebang is `#!/usr/bin/env node`, so the very next command in the runbook
failed. The installer already symlinks `openclaw` into `/usr/local/bin` **under
a comment explaining that systemd does not read shell profiles** — and had
applied exactly half of its own argument. Fixed, and then fixed again: the first
fix linked `node`, `npm` and `npx` and not `corepack`, which broke the _second_
install rather than the first.

**232 — root was the one uid the D-Bus rescue skipped.** `openclaw daemon
install` failed with _"Unit file openclaw-gateway.service does not exist"_ about
a file that `ls` showed and `systemctl --user enable` accepted by hand.
`resolveSystemctlProcessEnv` fills a missing `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` when the
bus socket exists and returned early for uid 0 — invisible on a desktop, where
`pam_systemd` sets it at login, and fatal on a server with no login session.
With that value missing the scope resolver falls through to
`--machine root@ --user`, which cannot see a unit under `/root/.config/`. This
one is **upstream's code**; the fork carries the patch and
`UPSTREAM-BUG-REPORT.md` carries the reproduction.

A fourth, not numbered because it is documentation rather than code: **§4's
`loginctl enable-linger` step comes after the two commands that need it.** On a
cold server neither can work until it has run.

### What the three have in common, and it is the finding

**The path a new operator actually takes was the path nobody had walked to the
end.** Every earlier verification ran on a machine that had already been used
for something else — Node already on `PATH`, a login session already
established, a dashboard already built. None of the three could have been found
by more reading, more tests, or another sweep of the code. They needed a
stranger's machine.

That generalises the rule findings 137, 224 and 230 each state about tests — a
check that stands in for something it does not exercise — and applies it to
**deployment instructions**. A runbook is only tested by a cold machine.

`docs-notes/LINUX-INSTALL.md` §2c now states all four as instructions rather
than leaving them as troubleshooting.

### Where the day ended

The Gateway is **running as a systemd user service on the VPS**, lingering
enabled, reached through an SSH tunnel, with the dashboard's Gateway gate passed
and the create-the-first-Root form on screen. `openclaw governance policy show`
answers _"Not signed in"_ rather than _"unknown command"_ — which is the proof
the fork is what is deployed, and the governance gate refusing an
unauthenticated caller exactly as designed.

**Not yet done: the Root account, the Kimi credential, the first provisioned
agent, and the live run.** Those are the next session, and T2 remains the
highest-value item on the project.

### Backlog

**T45–T48 added** at Kinan's direction: a first-run installation guide for a
newcomer, governance-specific setup wizard text (the wizard still says
"OpenClaw" and never mentions what this project is), a by-hand test plan across
the four RBAC tiers split between K, M and O, and a judgement on whether
Chapter 3 is ready to be written.
